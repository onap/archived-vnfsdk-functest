      "message": "The jersey versions have to stay at 2.25.1 for this moment, since it\u0027s still not been supported by dropwizard 1.3.5 [1][2][3]. From [3], we can say that the support for jersey 2.27 has been merged recently but it\u0027s targeting Dropwizard release 2.0.0. So we need to hold on for a while.\n\nBTW, I\u0027ve tried previously with jersey 2.26 [4] and this time with 2.27. Indeed, neither of them works locally for me.\n\n[1] https://www.dropwizard.io/1.3.5/dropwizard-jersey/dependencies.html\n[2] https://github.com/dropwizard/dropwizard/issues/2148\n[3] https://github.com/dropwizard/dropwizard/pull/2395\n[4] https://gerrit.onap.org/r/#/c/42683/",
